## ðŸŽ® Technical Features

- **Physics-driven gameplay**: All projectiles, debris, and certain environment objects use Godotâ€™s `RigidBody2D` and `CollisionShape2D` for realistic reactions.
- **Dynamic destruction system**: Objects can be pushed, shattered, or displaced by explosions and bullets.
- **Procedural wave spawning**: Enemy patterns, counts, and spawn points are randomized for replayability.
